# arduino sketchbook

some pieces of arduino & ruby code i skribbled when checking out my fritzing starter kit.

projects include:

## servo control

ruby scripts for communicating with your arduion boards via the serial port. includes an example using the volume control to make a servo move. Find the code in `./Servo_control`.

## the empathic servo

originated in a session at [agile design camp 2011](http://agiledesigncamp.org) in hamburg where Jeremy & me tried to make our eyebrows tweet with Kyle McDonald's [ofx facetracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker) - find the mac os binary that's needed [here](https://github.com/downloads/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/FaceOSC.zip). 

These events resultet in [Jeremy's eyebrows moving a servo](http://vimeo.com/27071189) and the [empathic servo](http://vimeo.com/27113323) that's controlled with smiling & kissing. find the code in `./facetracker/facetrackerservo/facetrackerservo.pde`.

Enjoy!
